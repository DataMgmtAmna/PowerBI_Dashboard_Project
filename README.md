**Project Context**: This dashboard was created for Evergy during my summer internship, focusing on different generator performance over a 20-year horizon.

**Dashboard Utility**: It showcases how each generator performs under various scenarios, providing insights into operational efficiency and financial viability.

**Visualization and Analysis**: The dashboard includes 10 distinct charts, each illustrating a different characteristic of the generator. For instance, the "Generation Margin" chart demonstrates the financial benefits to customers.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Each chart on the dashboard tells a unique story about the generator, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its various aspects and performance metrics.
